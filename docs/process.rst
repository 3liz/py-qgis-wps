PyWPS works with processes and services. A process is a Python `Class` 
containing an `handler` method and a list of inputs and outputs. A PyWPS 
service instance is then a collection of selected processes. 

PyWPS does not ship with any processes predefined - it's on you, as user of
PyWPS to set up the processes of your choice. PyWPS is here to help you 
publishing your awesome geospatial operation on the web - it takes care of
communication and security, you then have to add the content.

.. note:: There are some example processes in the `PyWPS-Demo`_ project.

Writing a Process
=================

.. note:: At this place, you should prepare your environment for final
        :ref:`deployment`. At least, you should create a single directory with
        your processes, which is typically named `processes`::

        $ mkdir processes

        In this directory, we will create single python scripts containing
        processes.

        Processes can be located *anywhere in the system* as long as their 
        location is identified in the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` environment 
        variable, and can be imported in the final server instance.

A processes is coded as a class inheriting from :class:`Process`.
In the `PyWPS-Demo`_ server they are
kept inside the *processes* folder, usually in separated files.

The instance of a *Process* needs following attributes to be configured:

:identifier:
    unique identifier of the process
:title:
    corresponding title
:inputs:
    list of process inputs
:outputs:
    list of process outputs
:handler:
    method which recieves :class:`qywps.app.WPSRequest` and :class:`qywps.app.WPSResponse` as inputs.

Example vector buffer process
=============================

As an example, we will create a *buffer* process - which will take a vector
file as the input, create specified the buffer around the data (using `Shapely
<http://toblerity.org/shapely/>`_),  and return back the result.

Therefore, the process will have two inputs: 

* `ComplexData` input - the vector file
* `LiteralData` input - the buffer size

And it will have one output:

* `ComplexData` output - the final buffer

The process can be called `demobuffer` and we can now start coding it::

    $ cd processes
    $ $EDITOR demobuffer.py

At the beginning, we have to import the required classes and modules
    
Here is a very basic example:

.. literalinclude:: demobuffer.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 10-12
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 10

As the next step, we define a list of inputs. The first input is
:class:`qywps.ComplexInput` with the identifier `vector`, title `Vector map`
and there is only one allowed format: GML.

The next input is :class:`qywps.LiteralInput`, with the identifier `size` and
the data type set to `float`:

.. literalinclude:: demobuffer.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 14-21
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 14

Next we define the output `output` as :class:`qywps.ComplexOutput`. This
output supports GML format only.

.. literalinclude:: demobuffer.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 23-27
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 23

Next we create a new list variables for inputs and outputs.

.. literalinclude:: demobuffer.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 29-30
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 29

Next we define the *handler* method. In it, *geospatial analysis
may happen*. The method gets a :class:`qywps.app.WPSRequest` and a
:class:`qywps.app.WPSResponse` object as parameters. In our case, we
calculate the buffer around each vector feature using 
`GDAL/OGR library <http://gdal.org>`_. We will not got much into the details, 
what you should note is how to get input data from the 
:class:`qywps.app.WPSRequest` object and how to set data as outputs in the 
:class:`qywps.app.WPSResponse` object.

.. literalinclude:: demobuffer.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: _handler
   :emphasize-lines: 8-12, 50-54
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 45

At the end, we put everything together and create new a `DemoBuffer` class with
handler, inputs and outputs. It's based on :class:`qywps.Process`:

.. literalinclude:: demobuffer.py
   :pyobject: DemoBuffer
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 32


Declaring inputs and outputs
============================

Clients need to know which inputs the processes expects. They can be declared
as :class:`qywps.Input` objects in the :class:`Process` class declaration:

.. code-block:: python

    from qywps import Process, LiteralInput, LiteralOutput

    class FooProcess(Process):
        def __init__(self):
            inputs = [
                LiteralInput('foo', data_type='string'),
                ComplexInput('bar', [Format('text/xml')])
            ]
            outputs = [
                LiteralOutput('foo_output', data_type='string'),
                ComplexOutput('bar_output', [Format('JSON')])
            ]

            super(FooProcess, self).__init__(
                ...
                inputs=inputs,
                outputs=outputs
            )
            ...

.. note:: A more generic description can be found in :ref:`wps` chapter.

LiteralData
-----------

* :class:`LiteralInput` 
* :class:`LiteralOutput`

A simple value embedded in the request. The first argument is a
name. The second argument is the type, one of `string`, `float`,
`integer` or `boolean`.

ComplexData
-----------

* :class:`ComplexInput`
* :class:`ComplexOutput`

A large data object, for example a layer. ComplexData do have a `format` 
attribute as one of their key properties. It's either a list of supported 
formats or a single (already selected) format. It shall be an instance of
the :class:`qywps.inout.formats.Format` class. 

ComplexData :class:`Format` and input validation
------------------------------------------------
The ComplexData needs as one of its parameters a list of supported data 
formats. They are derived from the :class:`Format` class. A :class:`Format` 
instance needs, among others, a `mime_type` parameter, a `validate`
method -- which is used for input data validation -- and also a `mode` 
parameter -- defining how strict the validation should be (see 
:class:`qywps.validator.mode.MODE`).

The `Validate` method is up to you, the user, to code. It requires two input
paramers - `data_input` (a :class:`ComplexInput` object), and `mode`. This
methid must return a `boolean` value indicating whether the input data are
considered valid or not for given `mode`. You can draw inspiration from the
:py:func:`qywps.validator.complexvalidator.validategml` method.

The good news is: there are already predefined validation methods for the ESRI
Shapefile, GML and GeoJSON formats, using GDAL/OGR. There is also an XML Schema 
validaton and a JSON schema validator - you just have to pick the propper 
supported formats from the :class:`qywps.inout.formats.FORMATS` list and set 
the validation mode to your :class:`ComplexInput` object.

Even better news is: you can define custom validation functions and validate
input data according to your needs.

BoundingBoxData
---------------

* :class:`BoundingBoxInput`
* :class:`BoundingBoxOutput`

BoundingBoxData contain information about the bounding box of the desired area
and coordinate reference system. Interesting attributes of the BoundingBoxData
are:

`crs`
    current coordinate reference system
`dimensions`
    number of dimensions
`ll`
    pair of coordinates (or triplet) of the lower-left corner
`ur`
    pair of coordinates (or triplet) of the upper-right corner


Accessing the inputs and outputs in the `handler` method
========================================================

Handlers receive as input argument a :class:`WPSRequest` object. Input
values are found in the `inputs` dictionary::

    @staticmethod
    def _handler(request, response):
        name = request.inputs['name'][0].data
        response.outputs['output'].data = 'Hello world %s!' % name
        return response

`inputs` is a plain Python dictionary.
Most of the inputs and outputs are derived from the :class:`IOHandler` class. 
This enables the user to access the data in 3 different ways:

`input.file`
    Returns a file name - you can access the data using the name of the file
    stored on the hard drive.
`input.data`
    Is the direct link to the data themselves. No need to create a file object
    on the hard drive or opening the file and closing it - PyWPS will do
    everything for you.
`input.stream`
    Provides the IOStream of the data. No need for opening the file, you just
    have to `read()` the data.

PyWPS will persistently transform the input (and output) data to the desired 
form. You can also set the data for your `Output` object like `output.data = 1` 
or `output.file = "myfile.json"` - it works the same way.

Example::

    request.inputs['file_input'][0].file
    request.inputs['data_input'][0].data
    request.inputs['stream_input'][0].stream

Because there could be multiple input values with the same identifier, the
inputs are accessed with an index.  For `LiteralInput`, the value is a string.
For `ComplexInput`, the value is an open file object, with a `mime_type`
attribute::

    @staticmethod
    def handler(request, response):
        layer_file = request.inputs['layer'][0].file
        mime_type = layer_file.mime_type
        bytes = layer_file.read()
        msg = ("You gave me a file of type %s and size %d"
               % (mime_type, len(bytes)))
        response.outputs['output'].data = msg
        return response

Progress and status report
==========================

OGC WPS standard enables asynchronous process execution call, that is in
particular useful, when the process execution takes longer time - process
instance is set to background and WPS Execute Response document with `ProcessAccepted`
messag is returned immediately to the client. The client has to check
`statusLocation` URL, where the current status report is deployed, say every
n-seconds or n-minutes (depends on calculation time). Content of the response is
usually `percentDone` information about the progress along with `statusMessage`
text information, what is currently happening.

You can set process status any time in the `handler` using the
:py:func:`WPSResponse.update_status` function.


Returning large data
====================
WPS allows for a clever method of returning a large data file: instead
of embedding the data in the response, it can be saved separately, and
a URL is returned from where the data can be downloaded. In the current
implementation, PyWPS saves the file in a folder specified
in the configuration passed by the service (or in a default location).
The URL returned is embedded in the XML response.

This behaviour can be requested either by using a GET::

    ...ResponseDocument=output=@asReference=true...

Or a POST request::

    ...
    <wps:ResponseForm>
        <wps:ResponseDocument>
            <wps:Output asReference="true">
                <ows:Identifier>output</ows:Identifier>
                <ows:Title>Some Output</ows:Title>
            </wps:Output>
        </wps:ResponseDocument>
    </wps:ResponseForm>
    ...

**output** is the identifier of the output the user wishes to have stored
and accessible from a URL. The user may request as many outputs by reference
as needed, but only *one* may be requested in RAW format.


Process deployment
==================
In order for clients to invoke processes, a PyWPS
:class:`Service` class must be present with the ability to listen for requests. 
An instance of this class must created, receiving instances of
all the desired processes classes.

In the *demo* service the :class:`Service` class instance is created in the
:class:`Server` class. :class:`Server` is a development server that relies 
on `Flask`_. The publication of processes is encapsulated in *demo.py*, where 
a main method passes a list of processes instances to the 
:class:`Server` class::

    from qywps import Service
    from processes.helloworld import HelloWorld
    from processes.demobuffer import DemoBuffer

    ...
    processes = [ DemoBuffer(), ... ]

    server = Server(processes=processes)

    ...

Running the dev server
======================

The :ref:`demo` server is a `WSGI application`_ that accepts incoming `Execute`
requests and calls the appropriate process to handle them. It also
answers `GetCapabilities` and `DescribeProcess` requests based on the
process identifier and their inputs and outputs.

.. _WSGI application: http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/terms/#wsgi


A host, a port, a config file and the processes can be passed as arguments to the 
:class:`Server` constructor.
**host** and **port** will be **prioritised** if passed to the constructor, 
otherwise the contents of the config file (`qywps.cfg`) are used. 


Use the `run` method to start the server::

    ...
    s = Server(host='localhost', processes=processes, config_file=config_file)
    s.run()
    ...

To make the server visible from another computer, replace ``localhost`` with ``0.0.0.0``.
