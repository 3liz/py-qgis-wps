Description
===========

Py-QGIS-WPS is an implementation of the [Web Processing Service](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wps)
standard from the Open Geospatial Consortium based on the QGIS Processing API.

It also implements the [processes OGC REST api](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes/)

This implementation allows you to expose and run on a server:
* QGIS Processing algorithms available on Desktop
* QGIS Processing models and scripts
* QGIS plugins having a Processing provider according to their `metadata.txt` file

It's is written in Python and is a fork of [PyWPS](https://pywps.org/).

.. _server_requirements:

Requirements and limitations
----------------------------

- Python 3.7+ only
- Windows not officially supported
- Redis server

Any WPS client should work with this implementation. For instance QGIS Processing algorithms are available
in a web interface using [Lizmap WPS module](https://github.com/3liz/lizmap-wps-web-client-module).

Installation
============

.. _server_source_install:

Install from source
-------------------

* Install from sources::

    pip install -e .

* Install from build version X.Y.Z::

Running the server
==================

The server does not run as a daemon by itself, there is several way to run a command as a daemon.

For example:

* Use `Supervisor <http://supervisord.org/>`_. Will gives you full control over logs and server status notifications.
